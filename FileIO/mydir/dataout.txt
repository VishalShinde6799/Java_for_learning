You, yes you...
You are beautiful and adorable..
Today is a lovely day and I'm glad that you are by my side..
Just smile for it makes me happy..!
Be mad at me, be angry, be upset with me for it will keep my head in place when it comes to treating you right.
Remember that I can't afford to lose you. Be everything, just don't be gone..!
Be my ambition, be my expectation, be my dream, be my life.
Be my reason. Springs, winter, summer... be my every season.
Be my calmness, my chaos, my panic, my anger.... Be my everything, just don't be a stranger.
